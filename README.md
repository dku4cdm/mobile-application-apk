History


It was the 3457 year, a few centuries ago the Earth lost after a nuclear war... 
	We are the last survivors flew away from Earth in the hope of finding a new planet on which we begin to live again...
	But as nobody counted on such a long journey, we have almost no resources and no I'm not talking about the food and water (despite the fact that synthetics are not really the taste is still possible to eat), I'm talking about fuel. 
	The only way his production is down in the past the flying asteroids in the hope that they have fuel. 
	Despite the fact that this asteroid is sufficient flow of resources (not enough for all engines but can move forward), we have a problem with aliens. They do not agree upon the world and almost ran out of ammo.

				I hope this is not my last entry 01.11.3457
